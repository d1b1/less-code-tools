# 'Less-Code' Tools & Solutions
A growing database of no-code, low-code vendors, tools and patterns. Startups
have funding, staffing and time constraints. Finding the right tools to keep
the march to revenue moving takes time and effort. This is my go-to resource
for thinking about non-code-centric approaches to getting a client growth-ready.

- Find No-code solutions
- Find new vs established.
- Find by how much funding the solution has raised.
